## Backend

In this project we're using Node.js instead of Spring Boot.

Node.js is an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications. Node.js applications are both asynchronous and non-blocking, whereas Spring Boot Java has a blocking I/O. Node.js developers can send many requests at the same time. Node.js also follows the agile development methodology which is ideal for enterprise application development projects that demand scalability. Additionally, Node.js does not require managing multiple threads, which is a problem associated with Spring Boot.


## Frontend

We're using Angular with Ionic.

Ionic + Angular is a great choice for creating hybrid mobile apps, as it provides a robust UI framework with many built-in components and features. It is also easy to learn and use, and provides a great development experience. React, on the other hand, is a great choice for creating single-page web apps, as it provides a powerful library for building user interfaces, as well as an extensive ecosystem of tools and libraries. React is also highly customisable, allowing developers to build custom components and tailor their apps to their specific needs. However, React is not as well suited for creating hybrid mobile apps, as it does not offer the same level of built-in components and features as Angular with Ionic.

## Game

The game will be developed in Unity.

Unity holds a bigger market share of 63% vs. Unreal Engine's 13%, making it the more popular choice. Unity is also easier to use and makes it easier to develop 2D games, while Unreal Engine is more complex and can generate more realistic, beautiful graphics. Unity also has a larger community, with more questions and answers available. Additionally, Unity is free to use, whereas Unreal Engine requires payment if your game reaches $1 million in revenue.
